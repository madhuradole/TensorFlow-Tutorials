TensorFlow tutorials implementation.

1. #### [Simple Linear Model](https://github.com/madhuradole/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/01_SimpleLinearModel.ipynb)

   This tutorial demonstrates the basic workflow of using TensorFlow with a simple linear model. After loading the MNIST data-set with images of hand-written digits, we define and optimize a simple mathematical model in TensorFlow. The results are plotted and discussed.

2. #### [Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/madhuradole/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/02_ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork.ipynb)

   The previous tutorial showed that a simple linear model had about 91% classification accuracy for recognizing hand-written digits in the MNIST data-set. In this tutorial we will implement a simple Convolutional Neural Network in TensorFlow which has a classification accuracy of about 99%, or more if you make some of the suggested exercises.
